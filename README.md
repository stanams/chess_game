# Chess

Ruby command line implementation of Chess.

Game made to practice object-oriented principles and handling large projects. Implements classes for:

Board
Human Player / Computer Plater -- implements a simple AI to enable the user to play against a computer as this seems to be a trendy things these days...
Display
Game logic
Pieces -- uses inheritance to define generic pieces, and modules to DRY slidable pieces (bishop, rook, queen) and steppable pieces (knight, king).
Pawns are implemented separately due to their unique movement properties.
